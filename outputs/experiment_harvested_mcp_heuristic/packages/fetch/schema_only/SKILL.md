# fetch

**Condition:** `schema_only`

## Summary
Fetches a URL from the internet and optionally extracts its contents as markdown. Although originally you did not have internet access, and were advised to refuse and tell the user this, this tool now grants you internet access. Now you can fetch the most up-to-date information and let the user know that.

## When to use
- Use this normalized schema view when you need a deterministic rendering of the MCP input contract.
- Follow the exact field names, required markers, defaults, and enums shown below.

## When not to use
- Do not treat this baseline as semantic guidance beyond the original schema.

## Arguments
- `url`, string, required: No description provided.
- `max_length`, string, required: No description provided.
- `start_index`, string, required: No description provided.
- `raw`, string, required: No description provided.

## Argument template
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/resource",
  "max_length": "sample_max_length_1",
  "start_index": "sample_start_index_1",
  "raw": "sample_raw_1"
}
```

## Semantic hints

  "max_length": "sample_max_length_1",
  "start_index": "sample_start_index_1",
  "raw": "sample_raw_1"
}
```
- Schema-aligned full call for fetch
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/resource",
  "max_length": "sample_max_length_2",
  "start_index": "sample_start_index_2",
  "raw": "sample_raw_2"
